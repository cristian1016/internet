            <h1>top 10 most visited websites in the world</h1>

            <p>
                According to this year's report, based on Similarweb data collected between December 2021 and November
                2022,
                Google remains the most visited website on the planet as of January 2023.
            </p>

            <h2>The Top 10 of the most popular pages on the Internet are made up of:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Google.com</li>
                <li>YouTube.com</li>
                <li>Facebook.com</li>
                <li>Twitter.com</li>
                <li>Instagram.com</li>
                <li>Baidu.com</li>
                <li>Aliexpress.com</li>
                <li>Wikipedia.org</li>
                <li>Yahoo.com</li>
                <li>XVideos.com</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="top_20">
            <h2>The top 20 of the most popular pages on the internet:</h2>

            <div id="content_img">
                <img id="top_20_img" src="/img/top-20.png"
                    alt="In this image they show the top 20 most visited pages in the world currently">
            </div>
            <p>
                When comparing the top with that of 2022, it can be seen that almost nothing has changed, in fact, the
                Top 5
                has
                been maintained with the positions of Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The only entry
                into
                the
                top 10 is Aliexpress, which ranked number 7.
                <br>
                In 2021, Yandex, the Russian Google, had entered the top 10, occupying the ninth place, but this year it
                did
                not
                occupy any position among the 20 most visited sites, something that is probably due to the
                Russia-Ukraine
                conflict. It can also be seen that the porn content pages remained within the top 20: Xvideos was ranked
                10th
                and Pornhub ranked 12th.
                <br>
                Aliexpress enters the top 10 of the most visited websites in the world
                <br>
                The e-commerce of the Alibaba Group takes a spectacular leap in the ranking and is now in the seventh
                position
                of the websites with the most traffic in the world, although it is still very far from the undisputed
                leader,
                Google.com. Aliexpress is the first eCommerce in the table, with nearly twice as many visits as Amazon.

                the

                previous

                In the case of Facebook, which registered 19.4 billion visits, with an average stay on the site of 9
