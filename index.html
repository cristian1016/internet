            <p>
                At the beginning of the Internet, we go back to the 1960s. In the midst of the Cold War, the United
                States
                created an exclusively military network, with the aim that, in the hypothetical case of a Russian
                attack,
                military information could be accessed from anywhere. from the country.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    After a long period of confrontation, during the last stage, the Soviet economic model stagnated and
                    the
                    United States strengthened itself militarily, which then positioned it in a favorable situation.

                <li>
                    In 1985 Gorbachev became Secretary General and was the one who promoted a series of reforms known as
                    Perestroika (restructuring).
                </li>
                <li>
                    After several rapprochements, at the end of 1989 Gorbachev and Reagan's successor, George H. W.
                    Bush,
                    They declared the Cold War over.

            <p>
                The Internet could be defined as a global network of computer networks whose purpose is to allow the
                free
                exchange of information among all its users. But it would be a mistake to think of the Internet solely
                as a
                computer network. We can consider computers simply as the medium that carries information. In this case,
                the
                Internet would be a great source of fun and practical information. With the Internet we can send
                messages,
                executable programs, text files, consult library catalogues, order books, make purchases,... It must be
                taken into account that all the resources that can be found on the Internet exist because someone has
                voluntarily He spent his time creating them.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This network was created in 1969 and was called the ARPANET.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In principle, the network had 4 computers distributed among different universities in the country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two years later, it already had about 40 connected computers. So much was the growth of the network
                    of a
                    communication system that it became obsolete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then two researchers created the TCP/IP Protocol, which became the communications standard within
                    computer networks.

                We will call each of the computers connected to the Internet a host. We must bear in mind that in a
                timesharing
                system, each main computer that supports various users connected through a terminal also receives the
                host
                name.
                <br>
                The computers that are connected to the Internet and provide some kind of service are called servers. To
                access
                this service we must have two programs that run on two different computers and that allow us to share
                resources:
                the server program runs on the host, which provides the resource, and the client program runs on the
                user's
                computer. allows you to use the resource. Examples: file server, print server, web server, ftp server...
                <br>
                The client program connects to another computer and requests help from a server program. As all Internet
                services make use of the client/server relationship, it is necessary to understand:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    how to run the client program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    how to tell the client program which server to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    which instructions should be executed with each type of client.

            <p>
                An Internet address is a uniquely identifiable name and location on the Internet. When someone sends a
                message, called electronic mail (e-mail), over the Internet, they need to specify where they are going
                to
                send the message. This 'where' is known as the Internet address. Each person connecting to the computer
                system has their own unique identifier, which is their address. By specifying this unique Internet
                address,
                you ensure that the message goes to the appropriate computer and ultimately to the appropriate user.
                Each
                computer connected to the Internet has its own address.
                <br>
                On the Internet, addresses are made up of the user identifier and the domain. The domain is divided into
                three subdomains separated by dots: computer name, institution name, and top-level domain name.
                <br>
                There are two types of top-level domains: organization domains (initially used in the US before the
                Internet
                was an international network) and country code domains in which a two-letter abbreviation represents an
                entire country. Outside of the US, geographic domains are almost exclusively used.

                It is the year 1983 that is usually marked as the year that "the Internet was born." It was then that
                the
                United States Department of Defense decided to use the TCP/IP protocol in its Arpanet network, thus
                creating
                the Arpa Internet network. Over the years it was left with the name of only "Internet".
                <br>
                On March 12, 1989 Tim Berners Lee described for the first time the hypertext transfer protocol that
                would
                give rise to the first web using three new resources:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>HTTP</li>
                <li>and a program called Web Browser.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The World Wide Web grew rapidly: in 1993 there were only 100 World Wide Web Sites and by 1997 there were
                more
                than 200,000. And from then on, the exciting history of the Internet continues to the present day. What
                a
                job! With how easy everything seems.
            </p>

            <h2>What does internet mean?</h2>

            <p>
                The name of the Internet comes from a need that, precisely, it was born to solve: to speed up
                communications. And it is that Internet is nothing more than an abbreviation of the terms Network and
                Interconnect. In any case, we could say that the Internet is an interconnected global network, something
                very similar to what the famous WWW means, world wide web.
